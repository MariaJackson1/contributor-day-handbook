Trello is a free project management tool used by many WordPress.org teams to organise their contribution.
While every team has different approached, in this guide you will find basic instructions about the app to get you started.

Trello is based on Kanban boards, a way to show how work proceeds, with each column representing a stage of the overall process.
At the top level you have the organisation, then you have teams, boards and cards. 

Signup
======
To use it you need to signup for it: https://trello.com/signup
You can use a combination of username/password or use your Google account. 

Teams
=====
A team is, well, a team :) It's a place to group people and boards. So if you think of using Trello to manage the projects of your Make WordPress team, this is the first thing you should create.


Boards
======
Boards are the heart of Trello. They represent a project or a container to keep track of information. They are made of cards ordered by lists. 
Each team can have one board or multiple boards, depending on the complexity of the project. WordCamp Europe has a team, and under it all the different subteams have a board.
