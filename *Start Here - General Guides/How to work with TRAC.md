## How to work with TRAC

[Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/) is an open source, web-based project management and bug tracking system. It is used by many parts of the WordPress project, including Core, Meta and Theme Review. Trac is based on working on tickets. Contributors use the tool to find tickets in need of work, monitor progress on open tickets and contribute patches for WordPress core.

### Working on open Trac tickets

1. Find a ticket ready for work by visiting https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/
2. Check the attachments and see if there is a current patch being suggested.
3. If no patch exists, replicate the scenario and [add a new patch](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/working-with-patches/).
4. If there is a patch, it likely needs to be reviewed and tested. The comments will reveal the current status of things.  Download the patch and test in your development environment. If it works as expected, please provide appropriate feedback.
5. If you make changes to the patch, please provide a link to the Diff (https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/working-6. with-trac/#comparing-ticket-updates) as well as a comment explaining what you changed and why you changed it.
6. Note:  patch upload itself does not trigger a notification. Please use [attachment:{filename}] in a comment to link to that patch.
7. Make sure to adjust the keywords on the ticket as necessary. More information on Trac keywords can be found at: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/trac/keywords/

If a ticket does not already exist for an issue, please open a new ticket. Instructions on how to do this can be found at: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/trac/opening-a-ticket/
