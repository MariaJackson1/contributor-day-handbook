## Start translating

  

[GlotPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/) is a plugin that turns WordPress into a translation management system. It allows collaborative work by [](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#translation-contributor) contributors and editors and is the recommended tool for translating WordPress core, as well as WordPress plugins and themes. To start helping with translations:

1.  Log in at https://wordpress.org
    
2.  Go to [translate.wordpress.org](http://translate.wordpress.org), where you will find a list of every language available for translating WordPress. If you speak one of the languages listed, you can click on it to be taken to the project page for that language.
    
3.  The translations are organized in projects and sub-projects so that you could have, for instance, the WordPress project and a sub-project for each version of the software. If a project hasn’t been completely translated (listed at 100%), you can find the untranslated strings and suggest translations.
    
4.  Before your translations become part of WordPress, they will need to be approved by a [translation editor](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#general-translation-editor) – a trusted member of the polyglots community. Translation editors are also able to appoint new translation editors.
    
If this is your first time translating for the WordPress project, we recommend you start by translating WordPress core, the foundations of the WordPress software that millions of people use every day as the base for their websites. However, if you would like to help with plugins and themes, it would be easier to start on a product you already use.

## Useful terms to help you get started

-   **Internationalization**: this is the method in which we make WordPress available in different languages and regions. Sometimes you will see it referred to with the abbreviation i18n - this stands for the initial and the final letter of the word and how many letters are between them!
    
-   **Localization**: this is the process of translating software into a different language. This term is often used interchangeably in this handbook with internationalization. It is sometimes referred to using the abbreviation l10n.
    
-   **Locale**: a locale (as opposed to ‘local’) is the combination of a language and a regional dialect. Locales often refer to countries. For example, Portuguese (Portugal) and Portuguese (Brazilian). The default locale for WordPress is English (U.S.). To define a locale we either use a language code plus a country code or the [ISO 639-3 code](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp) of a language.
    
-   **Rosetta site**: this is a term to describe the local WordPress.org site for a specific locale. For example, the Portuguese Rosetta site is [pt.wordpress.org](https://pt.wordpress.org/) and the Bulgarian site is [bg.wordpress.org](https://bg.wordpress.org).
